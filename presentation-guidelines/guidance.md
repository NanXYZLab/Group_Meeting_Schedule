## Presentation Checklist

- **Number of slides**
  As a general guideline, the number of slides should roughly match the presentation length
  (e.g., a 20-minute presentation typically uses ~20 slides).

- **Introduction for a broad audience**
  Our meeting group includes members with diverse research backgrounds. Please provide sufficient background and motivation for your work.

- **Slide numbering**  
  Please include slide numbers on all slides. This allows the audience to refer to specific slides easily and helps discussion.

- **Font size**  
  Ensure that text and figures are large enough to be read clearly by everyone in the room.

- **References**  
  Cite references clearly and consistently. Please use the same format for all references.

- **Discussion and engagement**  
  Group meetings are an opportunity for focused discussion, feedback, and brainstorming.  
  Take advantage of this time and feel free to ask questions.
